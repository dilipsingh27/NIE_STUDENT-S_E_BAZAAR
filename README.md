# NIE_STUDENT-S_E_BAZAAR
A Web application for Buy & Sell of items or can Donate also. Aimed for a college environment where physical communication is very easy between sellers(specifically Senior Students) and buyers(Freshers). Hence, can be used very effectively. For example, exchange of novels, buying second-hand books from Seniors etc.

Every freshers entering college has to face an initial period of hustle where they confused as to where they can get all important goods required for his day to day life. They wanders around for stuff like books(required for their curriculum), Mini-Drafters, Scientific-Calculators etc. At the same time when a guy moves from the 1st to the 2nd year there are alot of things which become useless to him. For example- a guy in the 1st year needs bicycle which a 4th year student has no use of.

This website provides a common platform for the sellers(Seniors) and the buyers(Juniors) where the sellers put up goods for sale or can DONATE goods also. The buyer can find the best price for a particular item. By this, the buyers no longer need to keep moving from Senior to Senior looking for goods which they needs.
